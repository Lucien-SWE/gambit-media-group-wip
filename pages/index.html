                    <p>Gambit Media Group began in August 2025, originally known as Gambit SMP — a Minecraft server
                        dedicated to
                        bringing creators together through collaborative gameplay and content. After ownership
                        transitioned
                        to
                        MayhemForge, our vision expanded beyond a single server.</p>


                    <p>What started as a small Minecraft community evolved into a full media group built around
                        creativity,
                        collaboration, and growth. Today, Gambit Media Group focuses on supporting a diverse community
                        of
                        upcoming
                        content creators across various platforms and genres — united not just by games, but by a shared
                        passion
                        for
                        creating and inspiring others.</p>

                    <p>At Gambit Media Group, our goal is to build a collaborative community where

                        creators
                        can
                        grow, inspire, and achieve more together. We believe in the power of teamwork — creators
                        supporting
                        creators
                        — to bring ambitious ideas to life.</p>

        <div class="video-placeholder"></div>

        <p>As part of your application, we ask that you create a 30-second to 1-minute video that showcases your
            personality. Use this time to talk about your hobbies, interests, or personal projects, and let us see what
            makes you unique. You're encouraged to express your creativity through editing and presentation, but editing
            isn't required — what matters most is that your video reflects who you are and how you bring your
            individuality to the community.</p>
