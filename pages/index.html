        <h3 class="sub-section-header">Our Story</h3>

        <p>Gambit Media Group began in August 2025, originally known as Gambit SMP — a Minecraft server dedicated to
            bringing creators together through collaborative gameplay and content. After ownership transitioned to
            MayhemForge, our vision expanded beyond a single server.</p>

        <p>What started as a small Minecraft community evolved into a full media group built around creativity,
            collaboration, and growth. Today, Gambit Media Group focuses on supporting a diverse community of upcoming
            content creators across various platforms and genres — united not just by games, but by a shared passion for
            creating and inspiring others.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-section-header">Our Goal</h3>

        <p>At Gambit Media Group, our goal is to build a collaborative community where aspiring content creators can
            grow, inspire, and achieve more together. We believe in the power of teamwork — creators supporting creators
            — to bring ambitious ideas to life.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-section-header">Our Staff</h3>

        <p>Our staff are an essential part of Gambit Media Group, working together to support the community and ensure
            every project and event runs seamlessly.</p>

        <p>As part of your application, we ask that you create a 30-second to 1-minute video that showcases your
            personality. Use this time to talk about your hobbies, interests, or personal projects, and let us see what
            makes you unique. You're encouraged to express your creativity through editing and presentation, but editing
            isn't required — what matters most is that your video reflects who you are and how you bring your
            individuality to the community.</p>
